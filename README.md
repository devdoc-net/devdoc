#### Developer's Documentation Collections (aka API docs: http://devdoc.net) ####

----------
This website provides various API documentation from Java, Android, C/C++, Python, Perl to database, Linux etc.

Not only does devdoc.net provide API documentaions, it also includes **tutorials** and **manuals**.

**UNLIKE** other website who also provides documentations, devdoc.net's docuementations are all from the official websites. Just enjoy programming.
