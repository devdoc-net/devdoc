#### Developer's Documentation Collections (aka API docs: http://devdoc.net) ####

----------
This website provides various API documentation from Java, Android, C/C++, Python, Perl to database, Linux etc.

Not only does devdoc.net provide API documentaions, it also includes **tutorials** and **manuals**.

**UNLIKE** other website who also provides documentations, devdoc.net's docuementations are all from the official websites. Just enjoy programming. 

This repository in github just provides the index page. For the whole Developer's Documentation Collections, please go to [devdoc.net](http://devdoc.net "devdoc.net")
